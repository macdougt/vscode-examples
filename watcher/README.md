# watcher README

Watches editor for saves and records them into your VS Code history file (default: <HOME>/.vscode_history).

This is very useful for searching your own work and you can perform analytics on your own usage. Other events can be tracked but watcher currently tracks save points. 

Note: Auto Save can drastically increase the number of entries.
